## Inspiration
- The [Bitcoin Design Foundation](https://bitcoin.design) Guide was the primary source of inspiration, offering a comprehensive framework for creating intuitive Bitcoin products.

- The desire to build a highly educational Bitcoin-focused platform motivated the creation of BitEdu.

## What it does
[BitEdu](https://bitedu-tau.vercel.app)  is a responsive React.js frontend template designed to facilitate the creation of Bitcoin education websites. It adheres to the [Bitcoin Design Foundation](https://bitcoin.design)  guidelines, ensuring consistency and usability.



**Key Features**:
- **Responsive Design** ‚Äì Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Developer-Friendly** ‚Äì Enables backend developers to quickly launch a design-compliant Bitcoin education website, saving time and resources.

- **Education-Centric** ‚Äì Structured to clearly communicate Bitcoin concepts to new users.



## How we built it
Using my background in React, TypeScript, and advanced Web2 development (e.g., payment gateways, cloud security), I built BitEdu in just two days. I used:

- **Vite** ‚Äì For fast and modern frontend development.

- **Tailwind CSS** ‚Äì For responsive and scalable UI styling.

- **GitHub + Vercel** ‚Äì For source control and instant deployment.

## Challenges we ran into
- **Time Constraints**: Initiated the project with only two days remaining before the hackathon deadline.

- **Tool Limitations**: Initial attempts with AI tools resulted in designs that didn't align with the Bitcoin Design Guide and had issues like missing assets and crashes.

- **Hardware Issues**: Encountered frequent laptop battery depletion, hindering continuous development.

- **Distractions**: Managed interruptions from various communication channels during the development phase.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **Bitcoin Design Compliance**: Successfully developed a React frontend that aligns with the Bitcoin Design Foundation's guidelines.

- **Live Deployment On Vercel**: Deployed the application on Vercel, marking my first deployment using this platform with CI/CD integrated via GitHub.



## What we learned
- I gained a deeper understanding of Bitcoin, including technical concepts like sidechains and Bitcoin apps.

- I learned the importance of educational clarity and design standards in blockchain onboarding tools.



## What's next for BitEdu
- **Backend Development** ‚Äì Add a dynamic backend to allow for user-generated content, admin controls, and real-time content updates.

- **Expanded Content** ‚Äì Introduce tutorials, quizzes, and multi-language support to reach a broader audience.

- **Open Source Community** ‚Äì Welcome contributors to help evolve the project into a full-featured Bitcoin learning hub.

- **Funding & Collaboration** ‚Äì Apply for support from the Bitcoin Design Foundation or similar grants to expand development.
